# Calculator | The Odin Project

Calculator designed by myself using Javascript, in combination with HTML and CSS to create a simple UI, but with a full functionality. The project is for The Odin Project's *Foundation Path* and marks its completetion, demonstrating my understanding of the basics of Javascript.

This was the first project to fully test my abilities, I consistently found myself stuck and confused a number of times whilst trying to fine-tune certain features, *such as multiple operators,* but I gave myself time and continued to passively think in my spare time about the makings of the functions I had written and how they play together. That, and along with some help from Google, I finally managed to overcome this project.

For my next step, I will be continuing down The Odin Project's *Full Stack Javascript Path*.
